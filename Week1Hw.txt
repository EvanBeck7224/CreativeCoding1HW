GUI stands for graphical user interface. It uses images and menus for users to navigate a system. By interacting with graphics, the interface may receive input. Examples of GUIs are application icons or buttons on an application like minimize, maximize, and close. CLI stands for command line interface. This is an interface which uses text prompts to interact with a system. By pressing the windows key and typing "cmd", the CLI window may be brought up for use. GUIs are popular because of their accessibility to less tech-savvy people. Because of their intuitive nature, GUIs are the standard for consumer software. Some examples of this are computer applications like Firefox, Discord, and GitHub. CLIs are less user-friendly than GUIs but they offer more control and efficiency over a system than GUIs can. This means that in a more specialized, professional environment, they take the edge over GUIs. For someone to be proficient with a CLI, they must memorize commands to place into the interface. However, the benefit of this is a quicker execution of more complicated tasks. Whichever option of interface is used is dependent on the user's needs. If an easy to understand but shallow interface is desired, then GUI is great. If the user needs to perform complex tasks with efficiency at the cost of memorizing commands, then a CLI is the way to go.
